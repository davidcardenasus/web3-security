# Web3 Security Resources

We built this repo to ensure that everyone has access to security resources.
Web3 security is not a sexy topic, but it is essential to have a solid understanding of the basics. 
Hackers have stolen billions from users with countless damage to web3's reputation in the last several years. This is our contribution to solving that.

All URLs have been audited and verified by our team to be the official link.
